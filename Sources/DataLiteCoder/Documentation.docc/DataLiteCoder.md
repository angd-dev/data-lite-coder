# ``DataLiteCoder``

**DataLiteCoder** is a Swift library that provides encoding and decoding of models using `Codable` for working with SQLite.

## Overview

**DataLiteCoder** acts as a bridge between your Swift models and SQLite by leveraging the `Codable` system. It enables automatic encoding and decoding of model types to and from SQLite rows, including support for custom date formats and user-defined decoding strategies.

It is designed to be used alongside **DataLiteCore**, which manages low-level interactions with SQLite databases. Together, they provide a clean and extensible toolkit for building type-safe, SQLite-backed applications in Swift.
